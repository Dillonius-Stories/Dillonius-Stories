                            <p>I can see the future.</p>
                            <p>Now, I know what you’re going to say.</p>
                            <p>No really, I do.</p>
                            <p>But it doesn’t matter, it won’t change anything. I know that because I can see it so
                                clearly. I can see the future, but it is limited. By viewing the future, I change it,
                                because I’ll behave differently. I think that causes some sort of feedback. The bigger
                                the change the bigger the feedback and the feedback causes the vision to become blurry,
                                vague.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you toss a coin, I can peek into the future and tell you how it will
                                land. A small prediction, hardly any changes to the timeline. However, if I were to bet
                                my life on it, then it’s suddenly a much bigger deal. I get this wrong and I die. That
                                could result in a massive change. That massive change creates massive feedback, and that
                                feedback would blur my vision to the point where I can’t see anything. Not very helpful.
                                It is as though this power was specifically designed to be useless. I also suspect that
                                proving my power to someone is a big life change. I have tried before but every method
                                of prediction that would work to prove it, would also result in a big life change.
                                Nobody knows, or at least the few who do don’t believe me.</p>
                            <p>There are still some uses. I was going to order takeaway last week, but a quick peek at
                                the next day revealed nothing but a blurry mess. This takeaway was going to have a big
                                impact on me the day after I eat it. I can assume it’s not good.</p>
                            <p>I learned to pay attention to the blurriness over time. I used to just ignore it. When I
                                was younger at a party, I was chatting to a girl, it was going well, and I thought I
                                would lean in for a kiss. Well, I peaked at the future and saw it was blurry as hell,
                                couldn’t make out a thing. This kiss was going to be life changing!</p>
                            <p>I threw up.</p>
                            <p>My social life did not recover in school. The stress caused my grades to dip, and I
                                didn’t get into my chosen college.</p>
                            <p>That kiss was definitely life changing.</p>
                            <p>I’m usually looking a couple of minutes into the future, it took a while to get used to
                                it but these days it’s practically automatic. It’s useful, I can feel big events coming
                                when the future starts go get blurry. Sometimes I even get to see some useful stuff,
                                like some food I’m about to burn in the oven or some clumsy mess I’m going to make.
                                Things that would be annoying, but not have a huge impact on my life. It feels safe,
                                comfortable. Maybe I’m addicted to it, but it’s not like I’ll ever have to stop. It’s a
                                good system, I like it.</p>
                            <p>Mostly.</p>
                            <p>There is one worrisome detail. One thing I can’t take my mind off of most days.</p>
                            <p>Carling Street.</p>
                            <p>It’s a small street in the town where I live. It has two coffee shops, one local, on is a
                                brand. Three clothes shops, a book shop, an off license and a supermarket. Three
                                abandoned units that no shop wants and then several apartments on top. It was originally
                                built in 1927 but none of the original remains, it was last done up in 2018, they
                                narrowed the road and expanded the footpath. I know a lot about the street. Possibly
                                more then anyone else. I have spent hours researching it. Because it terrifies me.</p>
                            <p>The future has never been so blurry as when I am near that street.</p>
                            <p>Every time I go near it, the future practically disappears. I know it’s still there, but
                                I can’t see it, at all. I have sent other people down that street, and they have
                                reported nothing. They think I’m crazy.</p>
                            <p>I bought a drone and sent that down the street. The future was clear, no blurriness to
                                report. It seems that whatever is happening there, could only affect me in person.</p>
                            <p>The biggest event of my life is waiting for me there and I have no idea what it is</p>
