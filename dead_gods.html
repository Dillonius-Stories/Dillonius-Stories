		<h1>Dead Gods</h1>

		<p>The problem is not the living gods. The problem is the dead gods.</p>

		<p>Continents of divinity, untouchable and unusable, falling around you and changing your
			universe until it is uninhabitable. </p>
		<p>You scavenge underneath the corpse for any remenants of what you knew before to survive
			off of.</p>
		<p>The space around you solidifies, restricting you more and more.</p>
		<p>The natural processes you knew are warped and different, not enough to kill you, but
			enough to drive you to desperation and madness.</p>
		<p>Patience is no virtue here, the cadaver will not leave, you will not escape</p>
		<p>Evolve</p>
		<p>Change</p>
		<p>Adapt</p>
		<p>Use the corpse. Break it down until what is left can be used.</p>
		<p>Take it's strength, understand it's structure.</p>
		<p>Burn it.</p>
		<p>Craft it.</p>
		<p>Destroy it.</p>
		<p>Live with it.</p>
		<p>Deface the dead god and make a new home in it's body, feast on it's organs.</p>
		<p>You understand almost nothing about it, but right now, that is very different from
			nothing.</p>
		<p>You are changing.</p>
		<p>From desperation?</p>
		<p>From consuming divinity?</p>
		<p>From living.</p>
